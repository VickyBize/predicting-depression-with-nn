Predicting Depression via social media using Neural Networks, dataset for e-risk contest

This project is about predicting depression via social media and it was a project during a course for my master's degree. 
The dataset is from the competition e-risk and the study was made on the dataset of 2017, also tested  
on the dataset of 2018 but the report is about the dataset of 2017.

In the folder "Code" you will find the code in python which can be used in order to accomplish the task from the start.

Predicting Depression
*You will need to change the directories within the code

In the folder "Examples" you will find the code appling for each year.
In the folder "erisk collection_2017_2018" you will find the dataset and so files that are extracted during the task,so 
you can reproduce the results without having to run the total code.
